# Python Base
My study on the Python language


# The Project

This project contains several examples of what I am studying about the Python language.

## OOP

This file includes various examples of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) that I put into practice. It covers:

* Classes
* Public and private variables
* Functions that modify variables
* Data input from the prompt
* Use of Try-Catch
* Creation of Custom Exceptions for Try-Catch
* Declaration of static functions

## LIST

In this section, there are multiple examples showing how lists and dictionaries work, ranging from basic to more advanced declarations. It includes:

* Creation of Lists and Dictionaries
* Different ways to create lists and dictionaries

## UTILS

Here you will find several other functionalities that are easier to implement here rather than dedicating a full script as in the other sections above. It includes:

* Creation of Decorators
